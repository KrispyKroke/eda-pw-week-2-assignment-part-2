// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We declare a variable called name and set its value to the string 'Dane'.
// A conditional if/else block checks to see if name is equal to the string 'Mary' without type conversion.
// If it were equal to 'Mary' it would console log "Hi, Mary!".
// However, the string is equal to 'Dane' so the else block runs and we console log "How do you do?".

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We declare a variable called secret without initializing.
// We declare a variable called code and set it to the number 123.
// A conditional if statement checks to see if code is equal to 123 without type conversion.  It is, so secret is set to the string 'super', and code is multiplied by 2 and set to its new value of 246.
// A second conditional if statement checks to see if code is greater than 250. It is not, so the code within this second if statement is not executed.  We then console log the value of secret which is 'super'.

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We declare a variable called isStudent and set it to the boolean value of true.  We declare a variable called age and set it to the number 34.
// We declare a variable called zip and set it to the number 55407.
// Next, an if/else chain is executed.  First, we check to see if both isStudent is true and zip > 80000.  It is not, so we then check if isStudent is false or age < 30.
// Neither of these cases are true, so lastly we check to see if isStudent is true.  It is, so we console log "Welcome to Prime!", and the code has finished executing.  The last else block is not executed.

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
// colorOne and colorTwo are reversed in the code.  colorOne should be set to 'blue' and colorTwo should be set to 'red'.
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;
//Only colorOne was set to 'purple' in the code.  colorTwo should be set to 'purple' in the if block of code between the curly braces as well.
if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;
//The condition says if temp is greater than 39 OR (||) time is greater than or equal to 4.  It should say AND (&&) instead of OR (||) in the code.  Then the console log will execute as specified in the description.
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;
//In the code, the  if statement condition is fine and can remain the same.  However,  if the condition as stated is true, we should console log "enter", and if it is not true the else block should execute with a console log of "no entry".
if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
